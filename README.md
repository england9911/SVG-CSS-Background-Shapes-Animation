# SVG-CSS-Background-Shapes-Animation

For a client project, we needed an animation to match the effects used on a brand video. After trying to use a pure CSS version and running into issues with Z-index, I just made a simple SVG file and animated the individual polygons inside it.

Uses jQuery to set animation class on hover, and to set another class that will reverse the animation after the initial animation completes.

This means the user doesn't have to *keep* hovering to see the whole animation.
